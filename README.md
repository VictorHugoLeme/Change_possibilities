# Change_possibilities
Given an infinite number of the following coins: Quarters, Dimes, Nickels and Pennies, and given a value in cents, the algorithm must return all the possible combinations of coins to make up the change.
For instance:
```
n = 12
where [quarter, dime, nickel, penny]
result = [
          [0, 0, 0, 12],
          [0, 0, 1, 7],
          [0, 0, 2, 2],
          [0, 1, 0, 2]
         ]
```
